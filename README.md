# DSA-Data-Analysis-documentation
Excited about learning data analysis.
I am learing how to effectively use MS-Excel, SQL, and Power Bi. I am being exposed to the different functions and codes that can be used to clean data; conveting unstructuerd data into structured data easily.
## Microsoft Excel
During the class, I was exposed to excel functios such as MIN, MAX, PROPER, TODAY,LARGE, AVERAGE, V&X Lookup, etc. I also learnt ways of visualize the cleaned data to make it more meaningful by creating pivot tables, graphs, barcharts, KPI cards, etc.
##SQL
I am learning how to write various codes ( CREATE, INESRT, ALTER, UPDATE, AND, OR, NOT) that will allow for data cleaning. ....CREATE table Employee() ;staffid varchar(10), First Name.
##Power Bi
I was introduced to ways of data cleaning by uploadeing the data either through excel,text/csv filesand transforming it to enable cleaning using the power query editor. I leant how to piovot, unpivot, append, merge data as well as data modelling. Colum quality, distribution, and profiling were also taught.
